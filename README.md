# Design-GenNO
A Novel Physics-Informed Deep Generative Neural Operator for Inverse Microstructure Design

## ðŸŒŸ Overview
**Design-GenNO** is a physics-informed deep generative neural operator framework for **inverse microstructure design**. It unifies **generative modeling**, **operator learning**, and **physics-informed training** to design microstructures that meet user-specified targets such as **effective properties** or **microscopic field responses**. **Key features** of Design-GenNO include:
- **Generative Neural Operator** framework combining **MultiONet decoders** with a structured latent space.  
- **Physics-informed training** using PDE residuals, reducing reliance on costly labeled data.  
- **Normalizing Flow prior** for efficient sampling and robust optimization.  
- Supports diverse inverse design tasks:  
  - Property-matching problems  
  - Microstructure recovery from field measurements  
  - Maximization of anisotropic conductivity ratios  
- Demonstrates strong **out-of-distribution generalization** beyond training data.
