# Design-GenNO
A Novel Physics-Informed Deep Generative Neural Operator for Inverse Microstructure Design

## ðŸŒŸ Overview
**Design-GenNO** is a physics-informed generative neural operator framework for **inverse microstructure design** in two-phase materials.  
It unifies **generative modeling**, **operator learning**, and **physics-informed training** to design microstructures that meet user-specified targets such as **effective properties** or **microscopic field responses**.
